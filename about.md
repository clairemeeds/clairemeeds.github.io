Welcome!
My name is Claire Meeds and I am a second-year Biochemistry major at California Polytechnic State University. I am also minoring in Biological Sciences with an Anatomy Concentration. I spent most of my childhood in Anchorage, Alaska, where I embraced all things outdoors: fishing, hiking, skiing, and exploring the beauty of the state. I have deep roots still in Alaska, so I hope to move back after I get settled into my career. Since I was 5 years old, I have been obsessed with the idea of being a dermatologist and helping people gain self-confidence through their skin. This is still a goal and passion of mine and I love experimenting with skincare products and learning about the skin. In my free-time (though I donâ€™t have much of it), I also love baking and cooking. I think it is so fun to experiment in the kitchen and create delicious recipes.
