# Experiences
- Bells Nursery and Gifts: Anchorage, Alaska. Since 2018, I have worked as a barista and customer service representative at my city's local plant nursery and coffee shop. Through this experience, my communication skills have drastically improved, and I learned how to remain calm in a fast-paced environment.
