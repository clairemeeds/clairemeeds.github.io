# Experiences and Volunteering
- Bells Nursery and Gifts: Anchorage, Alaska. Since 2018, I have worked as a barista and customer service representative at my city's local plant nursery and coffee shop. Through this experience, my communication skills have drastically improved, and I learned how to remain calm in a fast-paced environment. 
- Alpha Omicron Pi, Chi Psi Chapter: San Luis Obispo, California. Since the fall of 2020, I have been an active member in my social sorority. Starting in January 2021, I have served on my chapter's Standard's Committee as an elected representative for my grade. This committee focuses on giving girls in my chapter needed resources (especially financial) and focused on disaplinary hearings when a member was out of line, and gave fair and just punishments when necessary. This experience taught me about Human Relations in a professional setting, as well as how mediate conflict.
- Disability Resource Center, Cal Poly: San Luis Obispo, California. Since the fall of 2021, I have been a volunteer notetaker for the DRC at my university. Basically, I take notes in my upper-division STEM classes and upload them to a portal where students in my class are able to go back and review the class material, in case they missed something in class. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of neat penmanship and how to concisely state your point.
