I currently research under Dr. Katharine Watts (Department of Biochemistry) in her Epoxomicin project. My fellow teammates and I are studying the effects of manipulating the selectivity of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) for  a more cost-effective alternative to modern medicine synthesis, especially in regards to anti-cancer activity. My immediate focus is on mentoring and training newer members to the project. Since I joined in March of 2021, I have learned so much about Biochemistry, the Scientific Method, and the importance of dilligence and preciseness in the sciences. I spend roughly 10-15 hours a week in lab, and I love it so much. Being able to work towards a common goal in a hands-on setting is where I have gained the most valuable knowledge so far in my time at Cal Poly.
